Is there an appeal process if I receive a conformance request decision and I disagree?,"If you disagree with a conformance request decision, there are several levels of appeal. An interested party may request the Branch of Construction and Wage Determination review any decision made by the Branch. This is referred to as a branch review. All that is required is a letter listing the interested party’s concerns with the decision. Normally, a decision of this type is made within 30 days.Any interested party may also request a review and reconsideration. The wage & hour administrator conducts this review.  Refer to 29 CFR 1.8 & 29 CFR 5.13. Write to:U.S. Department of Labor Wage & Hour Administrator 200 Constitution Avenue, N.W.

Is there a nationwide SCA WD for the services my contract requires?,"Wage Determinations (WDs) classified as “nationwide” are typically for non-standard occupations, such as hazardous waste removal and river transportation.  Standard WDs cover most standard occupations. The wage rate for each standard occupation depends on the locality of the work being performed. The locality is ordinarily limited geographically to a particular county, cluster of counties, cities, a state, or (under rare circumstances) a region."
Is there a way to download assistance listings data electronically?,"The assistance listings data is available as an electronic download  in order to promote data sharing and provide a way for related government systems to download data reliably and efficiently.

Each assistance listing is associated with a unique five digit CFDA (Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance) number. Once you identify a federal assistance listing that you&rsquo;re interested in, you can link directly to grant opportunities on Grants.gov or follow up with that specific agency using the contact information provided."
What are phishing and spear phishing emails?,"Phishing is the attempt by cyber criminals to obtain sensitive information such as usernames, passwords, and credit card details or other account data, by disguising themselves as trustworthy entities in an electronic communication. Phishing emails attempt to lure victims into providing information through a mix of social engineering and digital communication expertise. Spear phishing emails are targeted to individuals or small groups, and use knowledge about recipients to appear legitimate. Both try to trick you into visiting fake websites, downloading infected files, opening attachments with malware, or providing sensitive information. Result? Attackers could get access to your passwords, credit card details, funds, Personally Identifiable Information (PII), or other sensitive business information."

What are some reasons that federal users are unable to migrate their roles?,"If their FBO.gov password is greater than 90 days old, a user will not be able to migrate.  beta.SAM.gov will be unable to match their password to our beta.SAM.gov database as expired passwords were not included in the data transfer from FBO.gov to beta.SAM.gov. A small group of users may be unable to migrate if their password was updated in FBO.gov after 9/30/19 and are attempting to migrate with that updated password prior to 11/8/19.  A complete set of active usernames and passwords will be pulled on 11/9/19 for migrations occurring after 11/11/19.  If a user has successfully migrated before 11/11/19, their account and roles in beta.SAM.gov will remain in effect.  If the organization that the user was linked to in FBO.gov does not exist in beta.SAM.gov hierarchy or is not mapped to the beta.SAM.gov federal hierarchy, roles will not migrate.   If the user has been assigned the same role in beta.SAM.gov, the migration will be blocked. If the user migrated or was assigned a higher level role (e.g. user has contracting officer role but tries to migrate a contract specialist role), the migration will be blocked."
What are the API Rate Limits?,"Daily rate limits have been set based on user access. The larger number of request per day will for users who have gone through additional checks to ensure there is a valid government need for the connection.Users can be issued an API key from their user account, or a user can be issued an API key for a system account.The daily rates are as follows:<p class=""sam-rich-text-editor-indent-a"">As a non-federal user, the limit is 10 requests/day.<p class=""sam-rich-text-editor-indent-a"">A Non-Federal user associated to an entity has a limit of 1000 requests/day.<p class=""sam-rich-text-editor-indent-a"">As a Federal user, the limit is 1000 requests/day.<p class=""sam-rich-text-editor-indent-a"">As a Federal System account, the limit is 10,000 requests/day."
What are the Davis-Bacon Related Acts (DBRA)?,"Congress has added the DBA prevailing wage provisions to approximately 60 statutes  that assist construction projects through grants, loans, loan guarantees, and insurance. These involve construction in such areas as transportation, housing, air and water pollution reduction, and health. Some of the “related acts” contain coverage criteria specific to projects funded under these statutes. A determination of whether the Davis-Bacon prevailing wage provisions apply to all or a portion of an assisted project requires reference to the actual labor standards provision in the related act."
What are the requirements for a DBA/DBRA contract?,"Contracts covered by either the DBA or a DBRA must contain clauses stating the labor standards requirements of the DBA. Under these labor standards, contractors and their subcontractors are required to pay laborers and mechanics employed directly upon the site of the work no less than the locally prevailing wages and fringe benefits paid on projects of a similar character. http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/far/22.htm#P146_22580 The DBA directs the Department of Labor (DOL) to determine such local prevailing wage rates or wage determinations. Federal agency contracting officials then place the wage determinations, also known as “general schedules,” in covered contracts.The geographic scope of the DBA is limited to the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The geographic scope of each Related Act is determined by the terms of the particular statute under which the federal assistance is provided.For prime contracts in excess of $100,000, contractors and subcontractors must also, under the provisions of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act, as amended, pay laborers and mechanics, including guards and watchmen, at least one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek. The overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act may also apply to DBRA-covered contracts."
What are the responsibilities of the contracting agency when accessing SCA Wage Determinations?,"Contracting offices are to follow the procedures set forth below: 1. The contracting office will obtain the appropriate SCA WD by accessing the beta.SAM.gov SCA Database prior to the issuance of a solicitation (IFB or RFP), exercise of option, contract extension, or contract modification.2. The contracting office will monitor the SCA Database to determine if an applicable WD has been revised. Wage determinations will be considered received by the federal agency on the date of their publication. The provisions of 29 CFR 4.5(a) (2) shall be followed to determine whether a revised WD must be included in the solicitation and subsequent contract. Electronic Code of Federal Regulations https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=99c9a20e960f56be66f17ae91b52c888&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=29:1.1.1.1.5&amp;idno=29For contracts that are the result of sealed bidding procedures:Any revision to a WD published in the beta.SAM.gov SCA Database 10 or more days prior to the bid opening shall be effective. Any revision to a WD published in the beta.SAM.gov SCA Database less than 10 days prior to the bid opening shall not be effective if the contracting officer determines that there is not a reasonable time still available to notify bidders of the revision.For contracts that are NOT the result of sealed bidding procedures:Any revision to a WD published in the beta.SAM.gov SCA Database prior to the date of award (or the date of a specified modification having the effect of a new award) shall be effective. Any revision to a WD published in the beta.SAM.gov SCA Database after the date of award shall not be effective if contract performance commences within 30 days of the award date. If contract performance commences more than 30 days after award (or the specified modification), any revision to a WD published in the beta.SAM.gov SCA Database at least 10 days prior to commencement of the work shall be effective and applicable to the contract.3. If it is discovered that the most current, applicable wage determination (i.e., covering the appropriate locality, occupation, type of service and fringe benefit level for the service to be performed) contained in the beta.SAM.gov SCA Database system was not included in the contract, the agency is required to incorporate the applicable wage determination in the contract as provided by 29 CFR 4.5(c)(2), 29 CFR 4.101(b) and FAR 22.1015.Electronic Code of Federal Regulations https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=99c9a20e960f56be66f17ae91b52c888&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=29:1.1.1.1.5&amp;idno=29Federal Acquisition Regulation http://farsite.hill.af.mil/reghtml/regs/far2afmcfars/fardfars/far/22.htm#P1022_198184 The presence of a wage determination on the WD database does not determine the applicable WD for any specific contract. Only those wage determinations placed into the contract at the time of the award, or by a modification having the effect of a new award are controlling. When the contracting officer selects a SCA or DBA WD using the beta.SAM.gov website Program and DOL later determines, whether before or after contract award, that the appropriate SCA or DBA WD was not incorporated in a covered contract, the contracting officer, within 30 days of notification by DOL, shall include in the contract the applicable WD issued by DOL."

"What does the ""deactivated"" status mean on my System Account?","If your system Account shows a &quot;Deactivated&quot; status, then you need to submit a new system account request.This is not a locked account, but means someone with permission selected to deactivate the account.At the time of deactivation, the API key, password, and other authentication methods are blocked as not authorized."
"What do I do if my System Account is ""locked""?","If your System Account shows &quot;0 days&quot; next to the hashed password, then your account is locked until you reset the password.Select the &quot;Forgot Password&quot; option.If you attempt to access the account again without resetting the password, during the locked state, the time your account is locked will be extended for 60 minutes from the time of attempted access. This is for security purposes."
What do I need to register with login.gov?,You need to create a login.gov account if you don't already have one. Your old beta.SAM.gov username and password won't work anymore.

"What is the process used for submitting, reviewing and approving a conformance request?","The governing regulations at 29 C.F.R §5.5 require that the following three criteria be met prior to submission of a conformance request to the Department of Labor (DOL):• The work to be performed by the classification requested is not performed by a classification in the wage determination; • The classification is utilized in the area by the construction industry; and • The proposed wage rate, including any bona fide fringe benefits, bears a reasonable relationship to the wage rates contained in the wage determination.The DOL Branch of Construction and Wage Determinations processes a conformance request using the process below: 1. The analyst will review the classifications on the wage determination to ensure that the requested classification’s work is not performed by a classification on the wage determination. If the work is performed by a classification on the wage determination, conformance is not needed, and the wage rate for the classification on the wage determination must be paid. If the work is not performed by a classification on the wage determination, then the reviewer will proceed through the conformance process.2. The analyst will determine the category (skilled, laborer, power equipment operator, truck driver). Then,  a determination is made regarding what the predominant “sector” (“union majority” wage rates or “su” weighted average wage rates) is for the subject category on the wage determination.3. The analyst will make a determination as to what is a “reasonable relationship”(see link below) based on all the classifications on the assigned wage determination within the category of the work being requested (unskilled, skilled, operator or truck driver).Typically, the DOL Branch of Construction and Wage Determinations processes conformance requests within 30 days of receipt.https://www.fsd.gov/fsd-gov/answer.do?sysparm_kbid=5393a7"

SCA provisions are applicable to contracts for which the principal purpose is to provide services in the United States through the use of service employees. The SCA requires contracting agencies to incorporate new or revised SCA wage determinations (WDs) into contracts for services for each solicitation, award, or modification to exercise an option, extend the contract, or change the scope of work (whereby labor requirements are significantly affected).  For service contracts $2,500 and under, SCA Section 2(b) (1) requires payment of the minimum wage in the Fair Labor Standards Act. For service contracts over $2,500, the act requires the contracting officer to incorporate into the contract."
What is two-factor authentication?,"Login.gov uses two-factor authentication to keep accounts secure.

"When filing an SF-1444 Conformance request, how does the analyst make a determination as to how a ""reasonable relationship"" is defined?","In those circumstances in which the duties of the proposed classification are not performed by any classification in the existing wage determination, the Department of Labor (DOL) Wage and Hour Division (WHD) will consider whether the proposed wage rate bears a “reasonable relationship” to the wage rates in the wage determination when such rates were not less than the rate for the lowest classification in the respective category on the contract WD.WHD has concluded that it better reflects the regulatory requirement that the proposed wage rate, including any bona fide fringe benefits, bears a “reasonable relationship” to the wage rates contained in the wage determination to consider the entirety of the rates within the relevant category (skilled classification, laborer, power equipment operator, or truck driver) on the wage determination and to not generally use as a benchmark the lowest rate within that category. You may find additional information regarding the application of “reasonable relationship” by reviewing the All Agency Memorandum 213 .http://wdol.gov/aam/aam213.pdf"
When is an SF308 submitted?,"A federal agency uses  a Standard Form 308 (SF308)  to obtain an applicable wage determination for a construction project not covered by a published wage determination.

Why does the  SCA WD include questions about existing Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBAs)?,"According to section 4(c) of the SCA, if the predecessor contractor used a CBA,the wages and fringe benefits contained in a predecessor contractor’s CBA will supersede any and all other wage determination requirements for the successor contract period of performance.   The contracting officer must prepare a CBA WD for the successor contractor that references the predecessor’s CBA and incorporates it into the successor’s contract action.  The CBA must be provided to the contracting officer on a timely basis and be properly executed by the signatories to the CBA (predecessor contractor and union) and be effective for wage/benefit purposes during the predecessor contract in order to control under section 4(c) of the SCA.  Therefore, the system allows the government contracting officer to establish a CBA-based wage determination for CBAs meeting those requirements.  For further details, please see 29 CFR 4.1b (b) and 29 CFR 4.163.Electronic Code of Federal Regulationshttp://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?c=ecfr&amp;sid=99c9a20e960f56be66f17ae91b52c888&amp;rgn=div5&amp;view=text&amp;node=29:1.1.1.1.5&amp;idno=29"

Why is there an odd and an even numbered standard area SCA Wage Determination (WD) for each locality?,"The Department of Labor (DOL) issues two wage determinations for each locality that are identical except for the fringe benefit requirements.  The even-numbered wage determination requires the contract to have a fringe benefit plan requiring compliance on an “average cost” basis.  This allows the contractor to comply with the wage based on the average cost of their fringe benefit plan when calculated on the entire service employee workforce.  This calculation is based upon total hours worked (including overtime hours, but excluding paid time off such as holiday and vacation) by all employees.  The  odd-numbered wage determination requires the contractor to satisfy the fringe benefit requirements on a “per employee” basis and compliance must be calculated using all hours paid (including paid time off, but excluding overtime hours).  The contractor must meet the minimum fringe benefit requirement for each individual employee and is not allowed to average there fringe benefit cost over the entire workforce.  You can find a more detailed history and explanation of these two fringe benefit methodologies at the library by reviewing Department of Labor’s All Agency Memorandum #188 and #197. If the “average cost” WD was used under the previous contract period, DOL rules require its continued use under 29 CFR 4.52.Electronic Code of Federal Regulationshttps://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/retrieveECFR?gp=&SID=8ee043b383f50f57bd0ea24a616095dd&mc=true&r=PART&n=pt29.1.4#se29.1.4_152"
